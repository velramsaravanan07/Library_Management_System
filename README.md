# Library Management System ðŸ“š

A Java-based Library Management System using various design patterns like Factory, Strategy, and Observer.




A Java-based Library Management System designed to manage books, patrons, and library branches efficiently.

The class diagram illustrates the relationships between key components:





DTOs: Book, Patron, Branch, BorrowingRecord, and Reservation represent data entities.



Repositories: BookRepository, PatronRepository, BranchRepository, BorrowingRepository, and ReservationRepository (with in-memory implementations) handle data access.



Services: BookService, PatronService, LendingService, BranchService, RecommendationService, and NotificationService encapsulate business logic.



Facade: LibraryManagementFacade provides a unified interface to services.



Controllers: UnifiedLibraryController, BookController, PatronController, LendingController, BranchController, and RecommendationController manage user interactions.



Relationships: Includes aggregation (e.g., Branch to Book via bookIds), dependency (e.g., controllers to facade), and implementation (e.g., in-memory repositories to interfaces).

## âœ¨ Features


Book Issuing and Return: Manage book borrowing and returns with status tracking.



Patron and Librarian Management: Add, update, or remove patrons and librarian accounts.



Multi-Branch Support: Handle multiple library branches, including book transfers between branches using the transferBook method (with ISBN as long).
